## How do we do it
For the app of the dental clinic we have implemented different technologies already mentioned above in "Stack" such as JavaScript, NodeJS, React, etc. Firstable I created a plan to face my project in terms of requirements that I wanted to have in our app and marked all the final points of the project, as you can see in the following picture:
<p aling="center"><img src="./dentalclinic/src/assets/readme.jpg"/></p>
Once I created the project I started connecting to the backend and then started manipulating the data to render it into my frontend project.
Finally I shaped the visual part of the project through Bootstrap React.

During the process I had few issues, the two most important with the navbar 

During the process I had some issues, the two most important was the dynamic rendering of the Navbar because I was not formulate the ternary functions correctly with the information that the token brought me was not correct, another of the difficulties that I had was the selector of doctors and treatments in book appointment without showing an ID number and with the name of services.

## Known bugs
âœ… Pictures into carrusel are not correct adjust.  
â¬œ The password in the register area is not encrypted
â¬œ Missing the correct instractions for the credentials  

## Future funtionalities
âœ… Create the functionality to delete a user by the admin
â¬œ Be able to delete appointments by a user and by an admin
â¬œ Be able to see the detail of a user and an      appointment by the admin and the doctor  
â¬œ Modify both a citation and the profile by the user
